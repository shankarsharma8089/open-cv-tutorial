-OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

-OpenCV lib is deployed for the detection of items, faces, Diseases, lesions, Number plates, and even handwriting in various images and videos. With help of OpenCV in Deep Learning, we deploy vector space and execute mathematical operations on these features to identify visual patterns and their various features.

-This lib is also fast and efficient, and can be used for real-time applications. OpenCV is also well-documented and has a large community of developers who can help with any issues.
